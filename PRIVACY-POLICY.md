## Definitions of terms
A web accessible server is a computer, reachable by anyone using a computer
who knows the address of the server. The address is often portrayed in a human-
readable format called a domain.

A Web Browser is a software program that allows a user to locate, access and
display web pages on the Internet. They are delivired to User using HTTP
(Hypertext Transfer Protocol), using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). A Web
Browser is able to translate the delivered data into human-readable content.
Web pages are stored on web accessible servers and are reachable by combining a
domain and a path to a resource on the server, which is called a URL.

A "browser extension" (also called an "extension" or a "plug-in") is a small
piece of sotware that adds a capacity or functionality to a Web Browser.
They make use of the same programming language "Javascript", the markup language
"HTML", and stylesheets "CSS" as most modern-day websites.
Browser extensions generally perform tasks only for a specific list of websites.

A browser extension often has an internal options page, accessible to User by
going to Web Browser's extensions overview and clicking the options button for
the extension. On this page, User can modify what the extension does. This data
is often stored locally or on a web accessible server.

Example products of Web Browsers are Google's "Chrome", Mozilla's "Firefox" and
Microsoft's Internet Explorer.

Example products of browser extensions are "uBlock Origin" by Raymond Hill
(gorhill), "Tab Manager Plus for Chrome" by stefanxo.com and "Sidebery" by
mbnuwq.


## Access to websites
The Extension is able to read any data from the domains "intra.42.fr" and any of
its subdomains, hereafter called "Intranet". It also communicates with the
domain "darkintra.freekb.es" in order to synchronize settings set by User for
The Extension.


## Storing of user data on web accessible servers
Any settings modified in The Extension's internal options page by User, will be
stored on a server located at the domain "darkintra.freekb.es", hereafter called
"Sync Server", for synchronization purposes. This is done in a secure manner:
the files on this server corresponding to User  can only be modified by User
using an access key, also called access token, generated by Intranet. This
access key is generated on request of User, after a visit of the URL
"https://darkintra.freekb.es/connect.php" in Web Browser and clicking the
"Allow" button on Intranet's website (domain: "api.intra.42.fr"). This access
key is never stored on the Sync Server.


### User data stored on the Sync Server
- Extension settings set by User, including but not limited to the following:
	- User's preferences regarding color schemes on websites
	- User's choice of allowing Extension to improve upon accessible websites
	- Visual customizations made for User's own profile on Intranet
- Personally identifiable information, limited to the following:
	- only limited to User's "username" on Intranet

No other personally identifiable data is stored on the Sync Server.


### Accessibility of User's data on the Sync Server
User's data on the Sync Server is publicly accessible by anyone who knows User's
"username" on Intranet. The data is accessible by going to the following URL in
a Web Browser: "https://darkintra.freekb.es/settings/-username-.json", where
"-username-" is replaced with User's "username" on Intranet.


### Request of deletion of stored user data on the Sync Server
User may request to delete all their data from the Sync Server by disabling
synchronization in The Extension's options page. It will be deleted immediately
after disablement, which will cause it to cease to exist, meaning the data will
no longer be accessible by anyone.

If User wishes to delete their data without having Extension installed, they
can request so by sending an e-mail to the creator of Extension.
See the paragraph called "Contact & communication" below for contact details.


## Use of cookies
The Extension does not make use of any cookies in any way or form.
The Sync Server does make use of cookies, but not to track User. Use of cookies
created by Sync Server is limited to identifying User when accessing pages on
Sync Server's domain, in order to securely store User's data.


## Contact & communication
The creator of Extension can be reached by sending an e-mail to the e-mail
address fbes@student.codam.nl or freekbladnl@gmail.com. Any changes to this
Privacy Policy will be announced using pop-up windows on Intranet, added to
Intranet by Extension.
