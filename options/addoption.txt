A reminder for developers on how to add options, to not forget any steps

1. Add option to options/options.html and set default value
2. Add option to server/update.php as an expected value
3. Add default value to option in server/update.php
4. Add default value to background.js
5. If a theme or color scheme, add CSS file to web_accessible_resources in both manifests
6. Make sure the extension does not throw an error anywhere if the setting is not set yet, although this should never happen since on update, all unset settings are set to default by background.js
