## Contributing
In case you find any white spots on Intra or would like to modify any of the styles, feel free to do so! Use GitHub's built-in editor in dark.css, or for more advanced stuff use the following steps:
1. [Fork](https://github.com/FreekBes/dark_intra/fork) and clone the project
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b branch-name` (to switch to this branch later on, remove the `-b` flag)
3. Open [the extensions page](chrome://extensions/) in your web browser
4. Click the *Load unpacked* button
5. Make your changes and verify that they work as intended (also please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file)
6. Push to your fork (`git push --set-upstream branch-name`) and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/FreekBes/dark_intra/compare)

After having completed these steps, I will review your modifications to the code and decide on the implementation in the published extension.
