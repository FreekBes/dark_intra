## Installation
Available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hmflgigeigiejaogcgamkecmlibcpdgo/). If you are using a Mac at Codam, you'll find that any extensions you install will get removed after logging out. I wrote a small script for this, which fixes this issue by forcefully installing the extension to your macOS profile. You can find this script [here](https://github.com/FreekBes/codam_auto_extension_installer).

For Firefox, please see the [Releases](https://github.com/FreekBes/dark_intra/releases) page. Mozilla has decided to no longer host this extension due to it being for a "limited/non-public audience" (your loss, Mozilla). The extension **should** still automatically update using GitHub.
