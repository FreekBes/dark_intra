## Full list of features
- A fully working **dark theme**, which even works for staff accounts
- **Customizable banners** for user profiles, which are even visible to other users with the extension installed
- When a user is logged in, clicking on their location will open up a **cluster map** and mark their location
- Add a **link to your GitHub** on your Intra profile, visible to anyone with the extension installed
- An option to use the old Black Hole countdown in profile banners
- Removal of the annoying broadcasts button, which is unused by most campuses
- An option to hide the entire Black Hole date from Intra for less stress
- Replacement of the Black Hole for Codam students, simply showing the progress towards their **Monitoring System** instead (formerly part of [Monitoring System Progress for Intra](https://github.com/FreekBes/codam_intra_monit_system_display))
- Weekdays for agenda items
- Color schemes for the website: change your theme color!
- Fixed many small but annoying OCD-triggering design mistakes
- Add small **animations** here and there to soothe the eyes
- An option to auto-equip coalition rank titles when studying at Codam
- All your settings for the extension are synced using the 42 API, meaning it works cross-browser and **without having to sign in to Google Chrome**
- A few easter eggs here and there #haha


## Installation
Available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hmflgigeigiejaogcgamkecmlibcpdgo/). If you are using a Mac at Codam, you'll find that any extensions you install often get removed after logging out. I wrote a small script for this, which fixes this issue by forcefully installing the extension to your macOS profile. You can find this script [here](https://github.com/FreekBes/codam_auto_extension_installer).

For Firefox, please see the [Releases](https://github.com/FreekBes/improved_intra/releases) page. Mozilla has decided to no longer host this extension due to it being for a "limited/non-public audience" (your loss, Mozilla). The extension **should** still automatically update using GitHub.
